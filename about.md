## About Nimrod Gutman
I'm a programmer and technology enthusiastic.
I live in [Tel-Aviv](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Tel+Aviv%2C+Israel) Israel and in this blog I'll try to share my experiences in solving interesting problems and blurb about cool technologies and concepts.

I currently work at [BillGuard](http://www.billguard.com) as a full stack engineer, I mainly do iOS but I'm also fluent in java and web development.

I'm available for any questions or remarks on the materials written here, don't be shy!
