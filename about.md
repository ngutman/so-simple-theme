Hey guys,
I'm Nimrod Gutman, a programmer and technology enthusiastic. I live in Tel-Aviv (Israel) and in this blog I'll try to share with you my every day experiences in solving interesting problems or just writing about cool stuff.

I currently work at [BillGuard](http://www.billguard.com) as a full stack engineer, I mainly do iOS but I'm also fluent in java and web development.

## Other things I do
* [Brew home made beer](http://geverbeer.com)
* BitCoin!
* Photography (Nikon D7000 + couple of awesome lenses)
